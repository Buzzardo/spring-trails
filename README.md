# spring-trails

This is a simple prototype for a documentation idea: Linking docs together to address concerns that cross projects. For example, a "Beginner" trail might connect the framework itself, Spring Boot, and Spring Security, linking to relevant parts of each one. For now, this is a very simple project that serves as a place for an idea and not much more.
